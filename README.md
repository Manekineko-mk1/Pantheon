## About Pantheon 
Pantheon is GUI application that allows users to display information regarding cameras in many different countries as well as a live-feed for non-protected cameras. 

## Installation 
1. ``git clone https://github.com/josh0xA/Pantheon.git``
2. ``cd Pantheon``
3. ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
4. ``python pantheon.py``
- Note: I will later add a GUI installer to make it fully indepenent of a CLI.
